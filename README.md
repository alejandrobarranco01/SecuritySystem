# Security System on Raspberry Pi Pico W

This project is currently in development. The goal is to create a security system that runs on the Raspberry Pi Pico W and is implemented using the Arduino IDE. The application will use the Pico W microcontroller and a PIR sensor to detect motion in a room. The system will be remotely enabled or disabled via text messages or a web server.

## Project Description

The project aims to create a simple, remotely controlled security system using the Raspberry Pi Pico W. A PIR sensor will detect motion, and the system will send alerts or take action when motion is detected. Users will be able to enable or disable the system remotely via a web server or text messages.

## Planned Features

- Detect motion using a PIR sensor.
- Remotely enable/disable the system via on the two methods:
  - **Web server**
  - **Text messages**
- Trigger actions or alerts when motion is detected.
- Future expansion to include camera integration for visual capture of detected movement.

## Development Plan

- Initial setup using Arduino IDE for the Pico W.
- PIR sensor integration for motion detection.
- Basic web server interface for remote control.
- Remote enabling/disabling of the security system.
- System status and log display via the web server interface.

Stay tuned for updates as the project progresses!
